# MEANr-api
Express API server. Part of [MEANr](https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr) - A MEAN relational stack

DEMO: https://meanr.io

#### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org) installed

2. Fork or Clone this repo ``` git clone https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr-api.git ```

3. Install dependencies ``` npm install ```

4. Create an empty database on a MySQL server

5. Add the database connection details to ``` ./config./c_development.js ``` (and set other config details)

6. Run using ``` node server.js ```

7. Add your source code to ``` ./src/usr ``` and make great things

8. Fire up an app to consume the API - [MEANr-ng](https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr-ng) or [MEANr-ion](https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr-ion)

If you change any code in ./src/core then I suggest renaming the file so you can track and apply updates from the master repository.
